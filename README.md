<h3 align="center">Pac-Man Reinforcement Learning: a Q-Learning Agent in different environments</h3>

---

<p align="center"> The purpose of this project is to implement a RL environment in python of the Game Pac-Man, in order to train a Q-Learning agent, and study its behaviours with respect to variation in the environments.

## üßê Introduction `<a name = "about"></a>`

Pac-Man is a well-known game which was first released in Japan on May 22, 1980. The game was then
released in North America in October 1980. Pac-Man is a maze game where the player controls the titular character, Pac-Man, as he attempts to eat all the pellets in a maze. The game is over when all of the pellets have been eaten or if Pac-Man is caught by one of the four ghosts.

Many Reinforcement Learning approaches have been taken to create game achieving good results. The most recent algorithms are a variant of the Q-learning (Deep-QLearning) algorithm and uses a neural network to estimate the value for each state. These methods scan the game image as input and learn the Q function by a deep convolutional neural network. Applied to many Atari games by the [OpenAI gym platform](https://gym.openai.com/docs/), these methods give good results. As can be shown in the graph below (*[Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. &#34;Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning.&#34; nature 518.7540 (2015): 529-533](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/deep-reinforcement-learning).*), the PacMan game still has very low scores compared to other Atari games.

Thus, our work seeks to reimplement a simplified version of the game to be able to analyse the behaviour of an agent in front of various evolutions of the environment to understand what can be the blocking points during the learning process.
